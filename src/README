The contents of this directory (/src ) are structured as follows:

FILES:
PCB.c/.h            Defines the Process Control Block (PCB) data structure as
                    well as the functions and routines capable of working with 
                    it.

PageTable.c/.h      Defines the function interface with which yalnix can
                    interact with PageTables (generating, modifying, etc.)
                    So far, unused... may be unnecessary due to changing design.

kernel.c/.h         Declares all global kernel variables, implements critical 
                    kernel functionalities including the following routines:
                        - SetKernelData()
                        - KernelStart()
                        - SetKernelBrk()
                        - DoIdle()
                        etc..

linked_list.c/.h    A general-purpose linked-list data structure for use
                    throughout the project.

traps.c/.h          Defines the trap_handler_func type, creates the Interrupt
                    Vector Table, and implements trap handling functions.


SUBDIRECTORIES:
syscalls/           Contains the source code that implements the functionalities
                    related to system call requests from user code.
